# MetaLamp layout project

This is a project to find hotel rooms, to which I have devoted quite a lot of time. It was a necessary and interesting experience. While I was doing this project, I realized what component layout, preprocessors, assemblers, plugins, and much more are. That was cool.

# Demo: https://andreireznikov.github.io/metalamp-layout-demo

# Plugins:

 - air-datepicker: ^2.2.3,
 - chart.js: ^3.4.1,
 - inputmask: ^5.0.6,
 - ion-rangeslider: ^2.3.1,
 - jquery: ^3.6.0,
 - paginationjs": ^2.1.5,
 - slick-carousel": ^1.8.1

# Important

Most of the commits were lost in the process, due to the inexperience of the author. The project files from the folder were moved manually to a remote repository.

Due to incorrectly connected fonts at the initial stage of development, css files have become very large. An extension is used to track them .gitattributes. This issue has been fixed in the latest version.

# Start

To start the project, use the command __"npm run server"__ in the project folder.
